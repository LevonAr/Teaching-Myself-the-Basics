# Guide to this repo

Most of these programs dont serve too much real world functionality, but they really helped me get a grasp on what programming is at its core. The programs written in C specifically.

I initially uploaded everything in this repo so I could have access to all my code on my phone. Since it was just for my own viewing, I didn't put much effort into providing documentation. Now that I'm linking my github on my resume and I know people will be viewing this, I am going through and making things easier to decipher. 

Most of the code in this folder is actually executable, so I think I'm going to tackle the documentation in two sections. One titled "HOW TO RUN PROGRAM" which gives the reader directions on how to execute the programs, and one titled "BEHIND THE SCENES" that will break down the logic behind the code. 

Go to [Order_Search](https://github.com/LevonAr/Teaching-Myself-the-Basics/tree/master/Order_Search) first, since it has the nicest documentation as of today.
