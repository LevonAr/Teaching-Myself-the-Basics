# Resize

Resizes a BMP image

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 

This program is written in C, so you must compile it before you can run it.

In order to do this, you need a compiler. If you don't have one or don't know if you do, complete the following steps:

For PC:

1. Open Command Prompt and type
```
gcc -v
```
If gcc is installed then it should display a host of information starting with the sentence “Using built-in specs”.44

2. If you don't have gcc and are determined to run this in your Command Prompt, go to this link and follow the instructions to install gcc. However, the easier route would be to just use VScode.

For Mac:

```

```
