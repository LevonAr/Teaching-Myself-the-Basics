# Spellcheck
This program allows for the user to run a text file such as a book - it can be hundreds of pages long - and crossreferences the text file with a loaded dictionary in order to check for spelling.

I programmed this twice, once using hashtables as a way to store the words and once using tries.

This folder is really sloppy right now, I will clean it up soon.
