// At this point I have got a trie and a hashtable to succesfully work with the following time stats

/*Trie: 
TIME IN load:         0.35
TIME IN check:        0.02
TIME IN size:         0.00
TIME IN unload:       0.00
TIME IN TOTAL:        0.37

//I have two goals now. 
// Goal 1 - the more important goal: is to strenghten my understanding of how and why my programs work the way they do. 
// In other words I will make small tweaks and see if the program still works, and if it doesn't go into why.
// I especially feel like my hashtable program (although quicker) is very brittle, I will try to toughen it up. whatever that means

// Goal 2: make me programs work faster.
